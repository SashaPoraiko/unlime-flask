*** NOTES ***
- Implementations will be simplified, and project is packed as development project
- Csv files will be present in repo


*** QUICKSTART ***

1) docker compose up
2) When both services(web, db) is up and running, initialize db and make migrations:
    - docker compose exec web sh (go into web container shell)
    - cd core (go to flask 'app' directory)
    - flask db init
    - flask db upgrade

3) Now once again go to the shell (if you left it), and run the script to fill database from csv`s
(csvs should be present in repo)

    - docker compose exec web sh
    - python import_from_csvs.py

4) Check if records successfully imported into database,
if they are, we are good to go to test the endpoints

Endpoint urls:
    - localhost:5000/products
    - localhost:5000/products/{prod_id} (detail page, requires 'product_id' query parameter)
    - localhost:5000/make-review (POST method)
